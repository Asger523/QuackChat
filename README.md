This is a chat app I made as an assessment task at Pentia Mobile.

This chat app features:
  1. Authentication through Google Firebase using email and password or Google account
  2. Real time database through Google Firestore
  3. The ability to upload and send images using Cloud Storage and Firestore
  4. Three premade chat rooms with logos, titles, and descriptions

Changes I would like to make:
  1. Make sure the splash screen works properly on startup for both platforms
  2. Add Display Name input field on Sign Up screen and update the user as they are created (I already did this but it got deleted somehow)
  3. Add functionality to update user avatar
  4. Add an "Image loading..." indicator when images are being sent or loaded
  5. Add push functionality using Firebase cloud functions
