This is a chat app I made as an assessment task at Pentia Mobile.

This chat app features:
  1. Authentication through Google Firebase using email and password or Google account
  2. Real time database through Google Firestore
  3. The ability to upload and send images using Cloud Storage and Firestore
  4. Three premade chat rooms with logos, titles, and descriptions

The app is still missing push functionality but I did not have the time to add it.
